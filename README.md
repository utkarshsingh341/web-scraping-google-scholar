Abstract:

In a world where technological advancement forms the forefront of our lives, the foundation of this advancement is characterized by an exponential growth in research output from the scientific community. Research papers and their authors, however, have to go through an exhaustive ordeal to keep up to pace with the ever-changing demands of the publication committees. Hence, there is significant need for an interface that would allow researchers to easily download, sort and maintain their papers and publications with minimum work from the user end.
